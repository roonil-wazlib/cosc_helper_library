# COSC Helper:

A library of functions I frequently write to analyse algorithms for 261/262. Updated every time a new lab is assigned with boring repetitive content so I can spend more time on the fun stuff.

# runtime

Module containing methods to analyse the time an algorithm takes to run, depending on list input size.
Contents include methods for timing a single run on random input, getting an average time accross n runs on random input,
or timing a run on a given input list.

# plots

Module containing methods for plotting runtimes using matplotlib. Currently includes methods for plotting times taken by
a single algorithm, and for comparing runtimes of two algorithms on input sizes up to a given x_limit.

# languages

Module containing methods for answering languages questions in lab 1 so I don't have to do them all by hand. Includes stuff like finding all string combinations of a certain length given an alphabet, concatenating two languages and evaluating the number of different combinations of strings up to or at a given string length.
