# COSC Helper:

A library of functions I frequently write to analyse algorithms for 262. Will add more modules as I progress through the course.

# runtime

Module containing methods to analyse the time an algorithm takes to run, depending on list input size.
Contents include methods for timing a single run on random input, getting an average time accross n runs on random input,
or timing a run on a given input list.

# plots

Module containing methods for plotting runtimes using matplotlib. Currently includes methods for plotting times taken by
a single algorithm, and for comparing runtimes of two algorithms on input sizes up to a given x_limit.
